# **Overview**

Sustainable development of infrastructure systems is an emerging priority worldwide, and nature-based solutions are increasingly applied in navigable waterways to meet infrastructure needs as well as produce social and environmental benefits. This short course will cover how science-based guidance can inform decisions about waterborne infrastructure projects for two common areas of practice: sustainable sediment management and technical-biological bank protection. Participants will learn about the broader context for sustainable waterway management as well as technical guidance for executing these two types of nature-based solutions.

This short course emerged from three PIANC working groups addressing sustainable management of navigable waters. The following working groups and members are gratefully acknowledged for their direct and indirect contributions to this class:  

- Working group 214 - Topic - Chair, member, member.  
- Working group 236 - Topic - Chair, member, member.  
- Working group 128 - Technical-Biological Bank Protections for Inland Waterways - Bernhard SÃ¶hngen (WG Chair, Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute, Karlsruhe, Germany), Jeroen Verbelen (WG member, De Vlaamse Waterweg NV, Merelbeke, Belgium), Jos Wieggers (WG member, Rijkswaterstaat, Utrecht, Lelystad, The Netherlands), Kyle McKay (WG Member, Woolpert, New York, New York, USA), and Chris Haring (Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island, Illinois, USA).
