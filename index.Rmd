# **Overview**

Sustainable development of infrastructure systems is an emerging priority worldwide, and nature-based solutions are increasingly applied in navigable waterways to meet infrastructure needs as well as produce social and environmental benefits. This short course will cover how science-based guidance can inform decisions about waterborne infrastructure projects for two common areas of practice: sustainable sediment management and technical-biological bank protection. Participants will learn about the broader context for sustainable waterway management as well as technical guidance for executing these two types of nature-based solutions.

This short course emerged from three PIANC working groups addressing sustainable management of navigable waters. The following working groups and members are gratefully acknowledged for their direct and indirect contributions to this class:  

- Working group 214 - Topic - Chair, member, member.  
- Working group 236 - Topic - Chair, member, member.  
- Working group 128 - Technical-Biological Bank Protections for Inland Waterways - Bernhard Söhngen (WG Chair, Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute, Karlsruhe, Germany), Jeroen Verbelen (WG member, De Vlaamse Waterweg NV, Merelbeke, Belgium), Jos Wieggers (WG member, Rijkswaterstaat, Utrecht, Lelystad, The Netherlands), Kyle McKay (WG Member, Woolpert, New York, New York, USA), and Chris Haring (Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rock Island, Illinois, USA).

# **Nature-based solutions**

Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been defined as “actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services and resilience and biodiversity benefits” (UNEP 2022). However, from a practical perspective, NBS can be loosely characterized as having some of the following properties: (1) they perform infrastructure services, (2) NBS consists (at least in part) of natural or living materials, (3) they are intentionally designed for environmental and social benefits, and (4) NBS enhance resilience through self-adjustment. This presentation provides a general background on NBS and their relevance to navigable waterways. Specifically, two main themes will be addressed:  

- The convergence of infrastructure planning and biodiversity conservation, and how they has propagated into use of nature-based solutions. [Slides from Dr. Kyle McKay](PIANC_SmartRivers_NBS_Overview_McKay.pdf).  
- The use of nature-based solutions in ports, harbors, and navigable waterways with a specific emphasis on recent initiatives from the World Bank, PIANC, and the US Army Corps of Engineers. [Slides from Dr. Burton Suedel]().

# **Sustainable Sediment Management**

Sustainable development of infrastructure systems is an emerging priority worldwide, and recent U.S. policy directives favor implementing nature-based solutions. This session will cover how science-based guidance can be used to shape and inform future practices in the development of sustainable navigation infrastructure and to promote sustainable development and the use of nature-based solutions for waterborne infrastructure projects. Participants will be able to advance environmental and other benefits when incorporating dredged sediment in navigation infrastructure. Specifically, this session will provide an enhanced understanding of how to achieve more sustainable management of dredged material applicable to a wide variety of dredging projects in both coastal and inland systems.

# **Technical-Biological Bank Protection**

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
Globally, nature-based solutions are increasingly used for streambank protection in navigable waterways, leading to a proliferation of guidelines and recommendations. PIANC Working Group 128 was established to collect and condense expert knowledge in this field. The corresponding report is split into three parts, which are covered in this workshop:  

- [Part 1: Basics of a best practice approach](https://www.pianc.org/publication/technical-biological-bank-protections-for-inland-waterways-part-1-basics-of-a-best-practice-approach/)  
- [Part 2: Library of measures](https://www.pianc.org/publication/technical-biological-bank-protections-for-inland-waterways-part-2-library-of-measures/)  
- [Part 3: Decision support advice](https://www.pianc.org/publication/technical-biological-bank-protections-for-inland-waterways-part-3-decision-support-advice/)  
- [Spreadsheet tools accompanying reports](https://pianc.app.box.com/s/uh6bfl1lg6zmtn7uqol3qzfsjz2u6xu7)

These engineering guidance documents detail the planning and design approach (at the scale 0f 660+ pages!), but an abbreviated summary of this material will be provided here. Specifically, a mix of in-person lectures and videos are used to introduce both the reports and the experts working in these fields.
